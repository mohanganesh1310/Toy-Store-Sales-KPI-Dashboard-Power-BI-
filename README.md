# Toy-Store-Sales-KPI-Dashboard-Power-BI-
Power BI KPI dashboard for analyzing toy store sales performance with interactive filters and target comparisons.

This project focuses on building an end-to-end sales analytics dashboard for a toy store using Power BI, covering KPI monitoring, trend analysis, product performance, store-wise insights, and detailed drill-down reporting.
The data was modeled using a star schema consisting of Fact Sales and dimension tables for Products, Stores, and Date. Power Query was used to clean, transform, and standardize the data, ensuring accurate and reliable reporting.
